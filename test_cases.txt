Student: MEELAF BADER OTAIBI (44203353)
=================================================================

TEST CASE 1: Basic Example (4 Processes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Processes: 4
Arrival Times: 0, 1, 2, 3
Burst Times: 5, 3, 8, 6
Priorities: 2, 1, 3, 4 (lower = higher priority)
Time Quantum (RR): 2

Expected Results:
- FCFS: Sequential execution in arrival order
- SJF: P2 (BT=3) should execute before longer processes
- Priority NP: P2 (PR=1) has highest priority
- Priority P: P2 should preempt others when it arrives
- Round Robin: Each process gets 2 time units per turn

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TEST CASE 2: All Arrive at Same Time (3 Processes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Processes: 3
Arrival Times: 0, 0, 0
Burst Times: 8, 4, 2
Priorities: 3, 2, 1
Time Quantum (RR): 3

Expected Results:
- FCFS: P1 → P2 → P3
- SJF: P3 (BT=2) → P2 (BT=4) → P1 (BT=8)
- Priority NP: P3 (PR=1) → P2 (PR=2) → P1 (PR=3)
- Priority P: Same as Priority NP (no arrivals during execution)
- Round Robin: Interleaved execution with quantum=3

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TEST CASE 3: Realistic Scenario (5 Processes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Processes: 5
Arrival Times: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Burst Times: 7, 5, 3, 1, 8
Priorities: 3, 2, 4, 1, 5
Time Quantum (RR): 2

Expected Results:
- Demonstrates preemption differences between algorithms
- Shows impact of arrival time on scheduling decisions
- Round Robin will have multiple context switches

-----------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE FOR REPORT:
=================================================================
1. Open visualizer.html in your browser
2. Enter each test case data
3. Click "Generate All Visualizations"
4. Take screenshots of:
   - Performance Comparison Table
   - Average Waiting Time Comparison Chart
   - Average Turnaround Time Comparison Chart
   - Individual Gantt Charts for each algorithm
5. Insert screenshots into your Word/PDF report

RECOMMENDED SCREENSHOTS FOR REPORT:
- Test Case 1: Full dashboard (shows all algorithms working)
- Test Case 2: Comparison charts (shows algorithm differences)
- Individual Gantt charts for each algorithm (1-2 examples each)

=================================================================
OBSERVATIONS TO INCLUDE IN REPORT:
=================================================================

1. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):
   - Simple but can have high waiting time
   - No starvation
   - Convoy effect visible when long process arrives first

2. SJF (Shortest Job First):
   - Minimizes average waiting time
   - Can cause starvation of longer processes
   - Optimal for non-preemptive scheduling

3. Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive):
   - Respects priority but no preemption
   - Can cause starvation of low-priority processes
   - Good for systems with clear priority levels

4. Priority Scheduling (Preemptive):
   - High-priority processes can interrupt lower priority
   - More responsive to important tasks
   - More context switches than non-preemptive

5. Round Robin:
   - Fair time-sharing among all processes
   - Time quantum affects performance
   - Good for interactive systems
   - More context switches with smaller quantum

COMPARISON INSIGHTS:
- SJF typically has lowest average waiting time
- Round Robin provides fairest distribution
- Preemptive algorithms more responsive but higher overhead
- FCFS simplest but least optimal for performance
